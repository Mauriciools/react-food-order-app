# Food Order App

This project was a technical challenge from a React course I am taking.
The idea behind it is to simulate a food order app, where the user could select a desired meal and its amount. Based on the meal information, the food was added to a cart for placing an order in the future. You can also remove the meal from the card as well. Here, I practiced my knowledge about React components, useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext, useReducer, React props, CSS styling, and more! I hope you enjoy :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
